<p class="instruction">1. <img src="images/shareSettings.png" height="54" align="center"/> If you haven't closed the audio panel, so so now. Now select the Settings menu (the gear) and <span class="tap">tap</span> on <span class="action">Fix All Measure Duration Totals.</span> This will either truncate or add rests to measures whose total duration is less than or exceeds the time signature.</span></p>

<p class="discussion">Discussion: If you plan to import your score into a desktop music notation application such as Finale, it is advisable to make sure all of your measures have legal durations.</span>

<p class="instruction">2. Under the share icon <span class="tap">tap</span> on <span class="action">Export In Email...</span> then <span class="tap">tap</span> on <span class="action">MusicXML</span>. This will bring up an email client. Fill out the recipient and any other text you would like to add and <span class="tap">tap</span> on <span class="tap">Send</span>.</p>

<p class="discussion">Discussion: There are a variety of export formats to attach in an email and two formats (MusicXML and MIDI) that can also be saved to your iPad. When you choose <span class="action">Export MusicXML</span> or <span class="action">Export MIDI</span> (the first two options in the share menu), you will be able to find your files when you next synchronize with iTunes.</span>
