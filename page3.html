<p class="instruction"><img src="images/threeButtons.jpg" height="154" align="center"/> 1. <span class="tap">Tap</span> on the pencil button (the middle button at the far right) to enter <span class="action">handwriting</span> mode.</p>

<p class="instruction">2. Start to draw another quarter note at the end of the first measure. Then draw a quarter note in the next measure. As you move to a new measure, MusicJOT renders the previous measure. You can also just tap anywhere outside of the measure you are writing in or select recognize at the bottom of the screen. <img src="images/contextWrite.jpg" height="54" align="center"/></p>

<p class="instruction">3. Draw a slur between a note in the first measure to a note in the second measure. Then tap in the clear to render.</p>

<p class="discussion">Discussion: MusicJOT shows you a translucent paper-like overlay as you draw then will render each measure as you tap outside of that measure. In this way, when you start to draw in measure two, measure one renders - draw in measure three, measure two renders, and so on.</p>

<p class="instruction">4. Try drawing an accent over one of the notes (don't forget to tap outside of the translucent paper overlay to render).</p>

<p class="result">Result: You have just learned how to enter notes, slurs and articulations using MusicJOT's natural handwriting recognition engine.</p>
