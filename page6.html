<p class="discussion">Discussion: The virtual pointer can scrub a single note, an entire chord or the entire score. Switch between these three modes by double tapping on the virtual pointer. You will see one, two, then three dots, then it will cycle back to one.</p>

<p class="instruction">3. Continue to drag the virtual pointer over other notes.</p>

<p class="discussion">Discussion: In addition to scrubbing notes, the virtual pointer is an easy way to select anything in your score that you could select with your finger - but more precise and with magnification.</p>

<p class="instruction">4. <span class="tap">Drag</span> the <span class="action">virtual pointer</span> to an empty spot in one of your measures. Now in a separate gesture, <span class="tap">tap</span> the virtual pointer being careful not to move it.</p>

<p class="instruction">5. <span class="tap">Tap</span> the <span class="action">virtual pointer</span> button at the right of the screen again to close the virtual pointer. You can also scoot the virtual pointer offscreen in one quick motion.</p>

<p class="result">Result: You have learned how to use the virtual pointer to scrub, select and insert notes.</p>
