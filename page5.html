<p class="instruction">1. <span class="tap">Tap</span> in the <span class="action">measure bar</span> at any place between the start and the end of measure one.<img src="images/MeasureBar.jpg" width="85%" align="center"/> This will select all of the notes in both staffs.</p>

<p class="instruction">2. <span class="tap">Double tap</span> in the same place. This will select all the measures in both staffs.</p>

<p class="discussion">Discussion: The first method selects the notes individually while the second method selects whole measures. Selecting whole measures is a prelude to copy and paste operations.</p>

<p class="instruction">3. <span class="tap">Tap and drag</span> between measure numbers directly on the bar line separator to expand or shrink the measure width (you can't shrink the measure width beyond a minimum default value). The measure number will turn yellow indicating the measure width has been manually modified.</p>

<p class="instruction">4. <span class="tap">Long press</span> anywhere in the measure bar for the measure whose width you just changed to reset the measure to its default width.</p>

<p class="instruction">5. <span class="tap">Double tap</span> on the staff name to select an entire staff.</p>

<p class="result">Result: You have learned how to make more selections with the measure bar and drag and reset measure widths.</p>
